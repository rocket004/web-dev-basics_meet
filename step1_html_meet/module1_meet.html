<h1>Space Flight Dynamics Sources</h1>

<p> ... <p>
<p>This is my first attempt to share various links to an accurate and efficient core layers for building space flight dynamics applications.</p>
<p> ... <p>

<p> These links aims at providing accurate and efficient low <br>
  level components for the development of flight <br>
  dynamics applications. It is designed to be easily used <br>
  in very different contexts, from quick studies up to <br>
  critical operations. <br>

<p> Libraries provides basic elements (orbits, <br>
    dates, attitude, frames, ...) and various algorithms to <br>
    handle them (conversions, propagations, pointing, ...) <p>
